      Synopsis The Hunger Games begins on the day of the reaping in District 12.
      Katniss Everdeen, the story's 16-year-old narrator, sets out to meet her
      friend Gale so they can do some hunting and gathering before the reaping
      that afternoon. As Katniss makes her way from her home to the Meadow and,
      finally, to the woods, where people of the district are forbidden to go,
      we learn about Katniss' life in the impoverished part of her district, the
      Seam, and her family. She thinks about her sister Prim, who is 4 years
      younger, and her mother, both of whom have depended upon Katniss for
      survival ever since Katniss' father died in a mine explosion when she was
      11. The reaping is a nerve-wracking time because it determines which boy
      and girl, ages 12 to 18, will serve as the district's tributes in the
      Hunger Games. Two tributes are drawn in each of the 12 districts, and
      those tributes are sent to an arena where they fight until only one
      tribute remains alive. The victor gets to return home, and the victor's
      district is showered with gifts - namely food. The Games, put on by the
      Capitol, are meant to punish the 12 districts of Panem as well as to
      remind them of the Dark Days and how the 13th district was obliterated for
      its uprising against the tyrannical and cruel Capitol. Against all odds,
      Prim's name is selected at the reaping. Katniss volunteers to take the
      place of her younger sister and becomes District 12's girl tribute for the
      74th Hunger Games. Peeta Mellark, a boy Katniss' age and the son of the
      baker, is selected as the other tribute. She remembers Peeta and the
      kindness he demonstrated toward her when they were children, giving her a
      burnt piece of bread so that she wouldn't starve. Peeta's selection
      doesn't bode well for Katniss, who feels that she owes Peeta for saving
      her life when they were children, which is inconvenient considering she's
      now expected to kill him in the Hunger Games. Before she leaves, Katniss
      says goodbye to her mother and Prim; to Madge, the mayor's daughter who
      gives her the mockingjay pin, a recurring symbol in the novel; to Peeta's
      father the baker; and to Gale, for whom her feelings are already
      conflicted, wavering between friendship and love. Katniss and Peeta ride
      the train to the Capitol. On the train, Katniss experiences luxury like
      she's never known and gets to eat the richest, most decadent food. They
      both get to know Effie Trinket, their escort, and Haymitch Abernathy,
      their drunk mentor and the lone surviving Hunger Games winner from their
      district who, after seeing that Katniss and Peeta have some fight in them,
      promises he will sober up enough to help them survive the Games. After
      they arrive at the Training Center, Katniss and Peeta meet their stylists.
      Katniss is pleasantly surprised when she meets Cinna, a young man who
      dresses simply and wears very little makeup compared with the other
      stylists. In a strategy that has never been used before, Katniss and Peeta
      are presented as a pair during the opening ceremonies. They race through
      the Capitol in a chariot holding hands, their outfits blazing in fake
      flames, earning Katniss her nickname "girl on fire." Their entrance
      becomes the highlight of the opening ceremonies. After the ceremonies, the
      tributes begin their training. Haymitch coaches Katniss and Peeta
      together, per their request, and instructs them to keep their biggest
      strengths a secret from the other tributes. For Katniss, this means
      staying away from archery. After many years of hunting game in the woods,
      her prowess with the bow and arrow are unrivaled. The Gamemakers reward
      her skills, and her feistiness, with a score of 11 out of 12 during her
      private session with them. Peeta's biggest asset is his strength, so he
      stays away from weight lifting while he's around the other tributes.
      Haymitch tells them to remain together at all times, too. They are to
      appear inseparable, which, as the training goes on, becomes increasingly
      tiring for Katniss, who can't decide whether Peeta's kindness and
      compliments are genuine or simply a part of a scheme for winning the
      Games.
